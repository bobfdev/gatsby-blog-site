### Ice cream is the best.

I scream, you scream, we all scream, because there's no more ice cream. No one's rhyming about spinach.

Here is a description of this heavenly nectar from wikipedia on [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream):

> Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice)is
> a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
> dessert. It may be from dairy milk or cream, or soy,
> cashew, coconut or almond milk, and is flavored with a
> sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and any spice,
> such as cocoa or vanilla.
